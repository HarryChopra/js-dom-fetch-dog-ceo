# Fetch Dog CEO

## Challenge 1

```js
const imgUrl = 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/4';
```

Add JavaScript that:

-   on page load, fetches the images using the url above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
-   parses the response as `JSON`
-   adds image elements to the DOM **for each** ü§î image in the array

---

## Challenge 2

```js
const breedUrl = 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all';
```

After the first challenge is completed, add JavaScript that:

-   on page load, fetches all the dog breeds using the url above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
-   adds the breeds to the page in the `<ul>` provided in `index.html`

---

## Challenge 3

Once all of the breeds are rendered in the `<ul>`, add JavaScript so that, when
the user clicks on any one of the `<li>`s, the font color of that `<li>`
changes. This can be a color of your choosing.

---

## Challenge 4

Once we are able to load _all_ of the dog breeds onto the page, add JavaScript
so that the user can filter breeds that start with a particular letter using a
dropdown.

For example, if the user selects 'a' in the dropdown, only show the breeds with
names that start with the letter a. For simplicity, the dropdown only includes
the letters a-d. However, we can imagine expanding this to include the entire
alphabet.
